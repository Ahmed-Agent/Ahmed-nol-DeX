some fixes,  fix the following:

1/ THE suggestions lists (from,to) inputs,  and the MAIN SEARCH BAR:-
THEY SHOULD HAVE 2 STATES (ETH or POL).
ACCORDING TO THE STATE OF THE (SWITCH CHAIN BUTTON) EXAMPLE: 
IN (POL) STATE THEY SHOULD PULL, SHOW AND DEAL WITHIN POL TOKENS ONLY , AND CLEAR ALL INPUTS FROM ANY ETH TOKENS, REPLACE BY POL DEFAULTS.
 ALSO IN SWITCH TO ETH , LIKE THAT.

(YOU CAN USE MY CMC API AND COINGECKO) 
note " i added (VITE_CMC_API_KEY) it wasn't in the logics,  make it the second primary source for data with coingecko,  every 2 minutes switch between them , to reduce the over calling on one source so depending on the 2 " use these links they can help you to find reliable data.

2/Update suggestions lists and main search bar, each should show 14 suggestions or less if unavailable : top 50% should be ranked by market cap,  lower 50% should be ranked by the BEST 24h volume, NO DUPLICATES, EXPAND THE ALGOS TO BRING SHOW FASTEST PRICES AND THEN BEST , ALL SOURCES KEEP LOADING THE PRICES,  IF BETTER PRICE APEARS,  THEN IT SHOULD REPLACE currents.

3/ SWITH CHAIN BUTTON

 + CHANGES LOGICS, SWAP AND TRANSACTIONS TO DEAL WITH CURRENT CHOOSEN CHAIN ETH OR POL , 
ADD NEEDED CONFIGURATION.
+ CLEAR INPUTS smoothly,  user cant even notice, REPLACE THEM BY THE CURRENT CHOOSED CHAIN DEFAULTS
MAKE ETH CHAIN DEFAULTS SIMILAR TO POL CHAIN DEFAULT,  BUT INSTEAD OF (WETH,USDCpol) USE THE ETHERS TOKEN (ETH,USDCeth)
REMOVE THE HANDELER THAT SAYS (WRONG CHAIN).

(From,to) inputs make sure they are editable,  user can write and and also choose from their suggestions lists. auto blurr normalization.


4/Make the main search bar shows also only tokens from the selected chain . Move it a little bit below,  to sit exactly in the MID way between (the flotation logo , and the exchange container).

5/The iframe button: it has a text pop up (soon nol tools) keep it , but add other whole pop up says (75% swap fees flow to $NOL liquidity) , keep it in a separate pop up , only one at the time , they have beautiful sequence,  once (soon nol tools) apears,  other once (75% swap fees flow to $NOL liquidity) apears. 

6/Make sure that ther are a SERVER backend api , to secure our all secrets and configrations incliding the new eth configuration which you will add.

7/In eth state our fee is 1.2$ collected in eth coin , but calculate in USDC for stability,  
In Polygon keep the same 

8/ Go to this
 https://docs.reown.com/appkit/react/core/installation
It will make you understand how to install appkitt that let users sign in (connect) using their methods like gmail , x, and others . (MAKE SURE THAT CHAT SYSTEM CHECK FIRST IF USER CONNECTED OR HAS APPKIT USER NAME , IF NOT THEN OUR DEFAULT ASK APEARS)

9/FINALLY AND THE MOST IMPORTANT:
I WILL LET YOUR MAX EFFECTIVENESS HERE: 

+I WANT TO ADD TO THE APP SMALL NEW USER GUIDE LINES , ONLY AND ONLY NEW USERS ,
SHOULD 100% IDENTICAL MATCH OUR THEME.
THE IFRAME BUTTON NAME IS (SNAP) GIVES QUICK MARKET OVERVIEW from nol.pages.dev/snap
PUPLIC CHAT THE SPAMMERS NOT ALLOWED , enhance that user cant send bad words or insaults by trick ways like fuc instead of fuck or dik instead of dick.

THE VERY FIRST WELCOME SHOULD be professional ALSO ADHERES THAT ( 75% OF THE SWAP FEES GOES TO $NOL LIQUIDITY , STRONG CIRCUIT ⚡)
ADD GUIDELINES TO THE USERS HOW TO SWITCH CHAIN , AND END BY (SOON NOL TOOLS) 
WITH (SMOOTH MODERN AND MOST USED BY LARGE COMPANIES) INTRACTION , THEMED WITH THE WEB

+THE MAIN SEARCH BAR THE TOKEN SELECTED IS AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO FROM INPUT, SO IF MY WEBSITE (EXAMPLE.COM) I WANT TO MAKE IT also ABLE TO INPUT TOKENS IN THE FROM INPUT DIRECTLY FROM the URL (EXAMPLE.COM/0x?..any eth or pol address) . But if the address is eth address then the app state convert automatically to (eth state) if the url included pol address then the app automatically opens in (pol state) , making it flixable

+CHECK THE (SWAP , ALLOWANCE, TRANSACTIONS, FEES, USER TRANSACTIONS GUIDELINES, ALLOWANCE, NO ENOUGH FUNDS DETECT,  EVERY HINTS OR WARNING OR SIGNS AND EVERY THING THEMED TO OUR CURRENT THEME, WITH FLIXABLITY TO THE STATE) ALL OF THAT 
1/FOLLOWING MODERN STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS , 
2/FOLLOWING GLOBAL LARGE COMPANIES LIKE DODOEX, AND UNISWAP  ACCORDING TO THE great SMOOTHNESS Of swapping , to make us "RELIABLE SOURCE"
+ I uploaded you a photo of my logo,  replace the floating rotating logo reference,  to refer to this logo , and make sure it's suitable and smoothly rotating no breaks.
I hope
If you can make it 
our favicon and browsers icons and app logo too
