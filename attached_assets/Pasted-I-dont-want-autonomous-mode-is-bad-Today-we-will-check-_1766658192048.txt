I dont want autonomous mode , is bad
Today we will check for bugs , enhance , and do small improvements. 
So no heavy edits.

Cheack FOR 
1/ERRORS, and fix by the best
2/BUGS, fix by the best
3/we shold be SCALABLE TO TENS OF SOTHANDS USERS SEARCHING FOR DIFFERENT TOKENS at the same time.
4/ON CHAIN PRICING SHOULD BE 100% ACCURATE AND 100% FAST TO FETCH ALL 1K PRICES AND CACHE

Check the following "ONE BY ONE" so I confirm to you to proceed to the next one, 
SHOULD FOLLOW THIS CONDITIONS BEFOR YOU START:
+EVERY THING LIKE "BACKEND API &WEBSOKET" WILL BE DEPLOYEDIN CLOUDFLARE
+ deal with all tokens by contract address,  real chain data decimals,  and CHAIN ID , because we have two chains.
+dont use external api or open source as a fallback price.

+This is list of orders START WITH ORDER (1), "read only'' REMAINING and then we will do one by one.

1/GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT and  PREPARE, AND THEN SAY YOU ARE READY FOR THE NEXT ORDER
+MAKE LOCAL MEMORY CONTAINS A "COPY" OF THESE ORDERS WITH GUIDELINES FOR YOU. SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP 
+DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT 250 BIGGEST MC FROM COINGECKO IN POLYGON.
+AND DOWNLOAD 250 BIGGEST MC FROM COINGECKO IN ETHEREUM, PUT IN THE LOCAL HOST FILE .JSON FROM THESES 500 TOKENS IN "POL&ETH"
+CHEACK IF ALL "OTHER" LOCAL HOST TOKENS FILES AND ANY OTHER SOURCES "REMOVED", BUT KEEP SEARCHING BY CONTRACT ADDRESS FALLBACKS INTACT.

3/CHECK OUR OWN ONCHAIN PRICE FETCHER , IT USING ONLY MY SECRETS IF NEEDED IT CONTAINS ALL APIS AND RPCS NEEDED.
+THE PRICE FETCHING USE UNISWAPV2,SUSHI AND "QUICK SWAP IF AVAILABLE" 
+IT SHOULD NOT ASSUME DECIMALS, IT GET THE REAL DATA DECIMALS
+IT SHOULD NOT GET CONFUSED BY CHAIN OF THE TOKEN , BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH TWO CHAINS"POL&ETH"
+IT SHOULD NOT GET CONFUSED BY EXPECTING THE POOL TOKEN/USDTORUSDC, WHILE ACTUALLY IT IS USDT/TOKEN.
+IT SHOULD FETCH FROM ALL POOLS AVAILABLE FOR AT THE SAME TIME, AND CACHE THE" BEST PRICE,MC,VOLUME" IN THE SERVER FOR 20 SEC. 
+DEAL AND MAKE PROFESSIONAL ALGOS EXECUTION TO FETCH THE PRICE OF ALL 500 TOKENS IN THE 20 SECONDS , 250 IN 10 SEC AND 250 IN 10 SEC , CACHE BOTH FOR 20SEC ,

 AND CLEAR OLD CACHED PRICES IF NEW ARRIVED FOR THE SAME ADDRESS , TO AVOID CONTAMINATION.

+MAKE A PROFESSIONAL LIKE BIG AGGREGATOR FAST AND SUPER SCALABLE PRICE AGGREGATION.

4/ USER WHEN SEARCH SUGGESTIONS FETCHED FROM OUR NEW FILE 500, THE PRICE REQUESTS SERVER CACHED IMEADIETLY IF THE TOKEN SHOWS IN THE SUGGESTIONS,  SO THE DROPDOWN SUGGESTIONS CAN DETECT WHICH TOKENS USERS SEES IN THE SUGGESTIONS NOW , AND THE REQUESTS ONE REQUEST TO THE SERVER CACHING TO BRING DATA OF PRICE AND MC AND VOLUME,  SO USERS ALWAYS SEES FRESH CACHED
+THE REQUEST FOR EACH TOKEN IS ONE TIME , AND OTHERS USERS ARE CONNECTED BY WEBSOKET WITH THE FIRST USER REQUESTED. 
SO WE CAN REDUCE 90%OF RPC CALLS.
OUR CACHING SERVER RECIEVES RECIEVES REQUESTS BY "SINGLE FLIGHT"  EVERY 1.5 SEC.
+USERS WHO ARE SUBSCRIBED TO A TOKEN PRICE GET PRICE REFRESHED EVERY 8 SEC AS LONG AS THEY SUBSCRIPED , THEY GET UNSUBSCRIBED WHEN THEY CHANGE THE TOKEN AND NOT APEARS IN THE UI , THEN TTL STARTS FOR 5 MIN ONLY HE WILL STILL GET REFRESHINGS, AFTER 5 MIN HE GET UNSUBSCRIBE, (EXCEPT HE RETURNS TO TOKEN AGAIN AND THE TOKEN SHOWS IN THE UI THEN THE 5 MIN TTL STOPS AND RESTS AND WILL BE ACTIVATED WHEN THE TOKEN DISAPPEARS FROM THE UI AGAIN. 

+THE TOKEN SHOULD SHOW THE SAME PRICE IN
 "FROM/TO" & MINI RADAR & IN THE "SUGGESTIONS "
FOR ALL CONNECTED USERS

USER GET UNSUBSCRIBE AS SOON AS HE "CHANGED THE TOKEN IN FROM/TO INPUTS, OR THE TOKEN NOT SHOWING IN MORE IN THE SUGGESTIONS LISTS
 5MIN TTL starts if he comes then stops resets and wait.
+IN OTHER WORDS IF USER SEARCHED FOR A TOKEN then HE SUBSCRIBED WITH OTHER USERS SO WE STREAM SAME PRICE,
 IF the USER SEARCHED FOR OTHER TOKEN in (LIST & FROM/TO INPUTS) 
 5 MIN ttl THEN THIS USER GET UNSUBSCRIBED IF DIDN'T NOT COME BACK.


DEFAULTS SHOULD CONTAIN (POLYGON AND USDT FROM THE SAME .JSON FILE, ETH AND USDT FROM THE .JSON FILE , BRG MODE HAS NO DEFAULTS AND NO CLEARANCE,  WHATEVER USER SELECTED REMAINS

BE SMART

 
USE MY SECRETS APIS ONLY
