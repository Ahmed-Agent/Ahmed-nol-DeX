Focus and do the following:

I add new API (VITE_LIFI_API_KEY), for bridging primary and also swaps too . add it to our server backend to protect it from front end exposure,  make sure all secrets are.

Our swap logic mainly get qouts from "0x" and fallback to 1 inch , now i want you to update swap logic by the following:
Fetching the qout prices from "LIFI" primary with "0x" compare who is better price fast .
Make sure swap is working in both conditions (ETH/POL) and in the both routs always available (LIFI/0x) call & make all configurations need.

+The new "switch BRG condition" connvert very smoothly the app to AND convert the entire color palette EXACTLY LIKE CURRENT SMOOTH TRANSFORMATION between (ETH"blue"🔁POL''purple") The new condition hues is "Yellow hues" by shifting hue only, WHILE PRESERVING:

-saturation

-luminance / lightness

-alpha (transparency)

-gradients, glows, shadows, reflections, glassy and shine intensity..etc

-Do not flatten colors or recalculate contrast.
The UI should feel identical in depth, brightness, and hierarchy, with only a smooth color-family transition from to yellow and like that. Full circle (purple/blue/yellow) they are (POL/ETH/BRG)
+BRG CONDITION HAS NO DEFAULTS IT KEEPS what in there as its 

+BRG condition allows to users to SWAP within same chain or BRIDGE tokens too if the inputs are opposed each other chain (ETH&POL).

+So make swap button flexible in "BRG" condition to detect if both (from/to) inputs are in one single chain?  Then initiate swap using (0x&Lifi) if each input from different chain(ETH&POL) then initiate Bridging transaction USING "LIFI" ROUTE ONLY.

+USING ONLY MY "LIFI API KEY" NO FALL BACKS OR ALTERNATIVES when swap button detects inputs are opposed in chains.

+make sure our bridging provider always ready to give qouts , initiate swaps , brdiging , allowances,  approvals,  transactions,  and all neccessary . but only in "BRG" condition,  
In other conditions keep fetching qouts from "0x and lifi". best & fastes

+depending on the "switch chain button " it filters the suggestions lists.
If switch button is in "POL" it filters showing only (POL) chain tokens
in "ETH" , all lists shows only tokens in ethereum chain . 
condition (BRG) in this condition we combine both (ETH/POL) in one , so user can see, search choos any tokens in (ETH&POL) without chain filtering.we filter to show both ETH/POL .


+Text normalization during blur, it should only refer to the chosen tokens from the suggestions list ones, so not always normalize to the old or defaults . Fix that


+The main search bar,  which is below the "floating rotating logo"  move  it 0.5 cm down from it is current place , and it should show suggestions filtered by the website condition ETH OR POL , but if BRG filters to show both (POL/ETH) chains suggestions .

+In the lists and the suggestions and (from,to ) sections
remove only the word (/unit) from
 (price/unit)
But keep Fetching the price with fully decimals awareness,  with continuing refresh every 8sec
Dont use fallback mechanisms , fetch all prices in all (CMC or Coingecko every 2 min switch)&(0x)&(LIFI)&(OTHERS IMPLEMENTATIONS), with fast time windows, but always get the show the best price , keep other loading in background,  to detect any new best price 

+But The (24h%moves) every where always get it from (CMC OR COINGECKO) every 2min switch between them.

+some buttons like (iframe and puplic chat) buttons are highly layered,  it overlays appkit connect chip sometimes,  make sure they are in preferably layer
