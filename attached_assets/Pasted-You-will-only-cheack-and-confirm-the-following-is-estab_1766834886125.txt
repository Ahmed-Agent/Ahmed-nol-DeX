You will only cheack and confirm the following is established well: there is a dynamic watch list that detects all tokens selected by all live frontend clint, collected by singleflight from the server, every clint/user considered subscribered to the token data at the moment he SELECTS any token from suggestions Dropdowns in the "token search bar and tokeniputs bar" ttl of the subscription is the end of clint session, because connected subscribers will get analytics data:(24h%move,market cap,volume ONLY ) auto refresh frontend and cline side cachings to only tokens clint SUBSCRIBED to.
Data comes from initially from the server cachings if existed because our ONCHAIN system caching the fetched data because it  can listen and collect every8sec by a singleflight all tokens been added to the "tokensanalytics dynamic watchlist" and do immediate ONCHAIN fetching data and cache them with others, also server UNCONDITIONALLY refresh analytics of the full dynamic watchlist and cache them every 1 h global using gmt timing, so our server detects when new cachings added or updated he Imeadietly excute single flight fronend and clint caching refresh for only rpthe new cached data to the meant subscribers. to make onchan fetching every 1h for only the tokens inside , weather it lesser or more than the previous cycle. and by singleflight server refresh all subscribers token data/and the clint cachings if existed by the new data of the token, user is considered UNSUBSCRIBED only if went offline or ended the session,  because he considered subscribered to all tokens he selected during the session,  the server by singleflight refresh clints frontends immediately with arrived cached data if they dubscribed , every 1h server do UNCONDITIONALLY refresh dynamic watchlist and cached data so connected subscribers get the new server cachings to the connected subscribers, SERVER CACHINGS CLEARING WITH EVERY CYCLE tokens data and cachings, but also the server can detect new selected tokens because server every 8sec cheacks the dynamic watchlist, so he can do immediate ONCHAIN data fetch the tokens are new added because it has no cachings to show for subscribers ,then singleflight respond Imeadietly after caching the new data, then these tokens gets synced normally for the hourly refresh IF THEY REMAINED IN THE DYNAMIC WATCHLIST FOR THE NEXT CYCLE, clintes should always get through cachings, and if not there the server do UNCONDITIONALLY fetching and caching data first then refresh by singleflght to subscribers. CLINT SIDE ALWAYS CACHING THE fetched DATA  (volume, 24h%move and market cap ) ttl when the server auto refresh the subscribers  front end and cachings by the new data.
